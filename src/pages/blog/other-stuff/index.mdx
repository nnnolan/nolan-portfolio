# other stuff i've been up to

### meeple-a-thon

an earlier venture of mine was volunteering for Meeple-a-thon, a local board gaming charity event. i worked with the team on the 2022 event.
i was tasked with inventory management and data cleanup. i had tons of fun and it was immensely successful- the raffles, which i managed the entries, raised some $15k all for local homeless youth.

### fbla 

2023 was my first year participating in fbla. i qualified for computer programming & coding, computer problem solving, and cyber security. ultimately, i only pursued computer programming & coding.  <br />
nathan fletcher, a friend, programmer and also a fellow mizzou student, and i collaborated on this program. we were tasked with creating an app to track school events. the prompt was [here](https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla-topics/). 

we took fifth, which qualified us for nationals. i'll update this whenever we can relase our project, post nationals.

update 07/01/23 - didnt place in top ten of nationals but still learned a ton. check the archived repository [here](https://github.com/NatFletch/FBLA-Programming-2023)


### this website !

this website has been a fun project for me. i've been working with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and using [bulma](https://bulma.io/) for styling. i'm not super good at design, but i think it's coming along nicely, especially for my first time touching javascript, nevertheless react and gatsby.
