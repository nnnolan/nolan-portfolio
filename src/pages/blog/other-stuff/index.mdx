# other stuff i've been up to

## meeple-a-thon
an earlier venture of mine was voluntering for Meeple-a-thon, a local board gaming charity event. 
i was tasked with inventory management and data cleanup. i had tons of fun and it was immensesly succesful- the raffles, which i managed the entries, raised some $15k all for local homeless youth.

## fbla 
2023 was my first year participating in fbla. i qualified for computer programming & coding, computer problem solving, and cyber security. ultimately, i only pursued computer programming & coding
a homie, nathan fletcher, and i collaborated on this program. we were tasked with creating an app to track school events. the prompt was [here](https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla-topics/)
