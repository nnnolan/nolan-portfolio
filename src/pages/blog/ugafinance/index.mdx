# Experience @ UGA

I was with the process team from September 2022 to May 2023. We accomplished many thing, and I'm proud of the work we did. More than anything, I learned a lot about how to work with a team, and how to make a difference in a large organization. Technically speaking, I learned a lot about Python, namely Pandas, SQL, Spring API, and Salesforce. 

## Process Team

Some accomplishements we've hit:
<ol> 
<li>Data Archivial in Events, Communications, & Related Notes through Salesforce's Storage. Reduced Cloud Usage by <i> 25% </i> , saving 💰 for UGA. </li>
<li> Process Automation for Data Entry in Salesforce; instead of manual entry for large numbers of records, we can now use a CSV file to upload records, which is also built automatically ;) 📝</li>
<li> SQL Automation (ETL) Using Python's Pandas library to turn a multi hour process of layered <code> SELECT INTO </code> statements into a 5 minute process. 🏎️ </li>
<li> Developed a standarized strucutre for all data stored both locally and in the cloud.  🖇️ </li>
</ol>
