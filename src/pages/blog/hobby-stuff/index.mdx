# i'm a hobbyist, and i am always picking up new things to do


### writing
i'm a hobby writer on the side, and have taken a few awards for some writing, which is documented in the [awards](/awards) section. i really enjoy givig life to my words, and i hope to continue to do so. i don't have much documented as far as speeches go, but you can check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obHwnrB6aWc) video of my application for a scholarship i made for fun not quite expecting to get selcted. [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k2cPqpVRO9IRfcR7ciU6TNVw-qiEgSJSR3EYK50bIrU/edit?usp=sharing) is a more serious scholarship application, which i did indeed win. üìù

### nerd stuff

i'm a nerd, completely. i enjoy a lot of nerd hobbies, but i've been recently enjoying more physical games, namely magic the gathering and warhammer40k. in 40k, i've been having fun painting and playing with my friends, and i've been enjoying the lore of the game. in magic, i've been having fun with the deck building and expression part of the game. its been fun to flex my brain in both scenarios, and more than anything, i enjoy the social aspect of the games. üé≤ü§ñ

 ### stand up comedy
 
 probably my most unique hobby, i've been writing and preforming jokes since roughly the turn of 2023. i enjoy it as a side hobby and i hope to continue to do it for a long time. i've preformed at a few open mics, and i've been told i'm pretty good. i'm not sure if i'll ever be a professional, but i don't think ill ever get tired of the rush of being on stage. üé§
