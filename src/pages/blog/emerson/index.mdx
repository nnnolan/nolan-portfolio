# Experience @ Emerson ⚙️🤖

In the winter of 2025, I joined **Emerson** as a Co-Op Intelligent Automation Engineer. This role really pushed me to think about automation not just as coding or wiring robots, but as a way to help a massive global company run smoother. I got to sit right at the intersection of **hardware, software, and business**, which was quite cool.  

## Some Highlights 🚀  

<ol>
<li><b>SCADA Middleware:</b> Built a bridge between Universal Robot cobots and Emerson’s data science pipelines. This wasn’t just a one-off project, it became the <i>foundation</i> for a multi-year automation strategy across several production plants. 🤯</li>  

<li><b>Trade Compliance Automations:</b> I took a bunch of soon-to-be-sunsetted Robocorp bots and refactored them into Python RPA. Besides keeping critical tariff processes alive, I streamlined them enough to save over 2,000+ hours every year. 💸</li>  

<li><b>Executive Media Wall:</b> Worked with a teammate to design an interactive dashboard in Power BI + Power Apps. We pulled together nine key metrics into one big “media wall” for leadership — a tool that gave execs real-time insights into how the business was running. 📊</li>  

<li><b>Sharing Knowledge:</b> Hosted knowledge-sharing sessions with 250+ colleagues across the company. This was as much about tech as it was about sparking a culture of automation, sharing is caring. 🌍✨</li>
